### Introduction

Ageseq2-CLI is a command line interface (in Python) for identification of edited patterns from outputs of BLAT by aligning over thousands of reads to targets.

By default, the program will summarize the number of edited patterns supported by the number of reads per target sequence in the provided file (see `Usage`).


### Installation
#### Standard installation
For advanced users, you need Python 3.8+, Biopython, and pandas, to make Ageseq2 work.
You can find Python3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Once python is installed in your computer, you can install both Biopython and pandas modules through pipy easily:

    pytyhon3 -m pip install Biopython
    pytyhon3 -m pip install pandas
